the \n in the parentisis of the input function is for starting a new line when asking the question
The IF statement here is for if the users input = paris, print the feedback regarding the correct answer
the .strip() function removes the extra white space from the start and end of the strip,
therefor storing the users input without any extra white space
.title() makes the first letter of the word capitalized therefor in title form,
this method is used here to store the users input in title form
f is a method of formatting strings which makes it easier to add variables and commas
the ELSE statement here is used if the input isnt equal to the value stored in the Capital_France Variable,
if its not equal to the value stored in Capital_France it prints the feedback regarding an incorrect answer
