#Exercise 2 - Simple Sums
Num1 = int(8)  #This Variable has a integer value of 8
Num2 = int(10) #This Variable has an integer Value of 10
SUM  = Num1 + Num2   #this Variable has a value of 2 other integer variables assigned to them, Num1 and Num2. 
# This Variable is a sum of these 2 integer Vairbales.
print(SUM) #This print statement prints the Variable SUM which is the sum of the 2 integer variables, Num1 and Num2 .
