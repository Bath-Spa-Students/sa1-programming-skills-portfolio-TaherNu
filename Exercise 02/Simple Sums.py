#Answer to Exercise 2 - Simple Sums:
Num1 = int(8)  #This Variable has a integer value of 8
Num2 = int(10) #This Variable has an integer Value of 10
SUM  = (Num1 + Num2)   #this Variable has a value of 2 other integer variables assigned to them, Num1 and Num2. 
# This Variable is a sum of these 2 integer Vairbales.
print(int(SUM)) #This print statement prints the Variable SUM which is the sum of the 2 integer variables, Num1 and Num2 .
