info = {"Name" : "Taher Abdalla",
        "Hometown": "Sharjah",
        "age": "17"}
#this print statement prints the variables above on multiple lines using '\n', and string concatenation
print(f"Name: {info['Name']}\nHometown: {info['Hometown']}\nAge: {info['age']}")
#The variable age has been converted into a string as string concatenation cannot be used with integar values
